DoubleSlideExpandableListView with animation and double level (improvements from tjerkw project)


You can find some examples of use for this library in the file MainActivity.java

Improvements :

- Allows to launch a task before animating the list (download datas...)
- Smoother animation with ViewHolder pattern on ListView
- And so many more I forgot xD
